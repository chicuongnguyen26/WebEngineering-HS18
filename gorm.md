1. We are going to create a room reservation system. What do we need?
1. We create the DB entities and we write DB tests (integration tests?).
1. We define contraints and extend the tests.
1. We explain where the entities will be stored. We switch to file based DB and we use IDEA to browse the DB. We understand how IDs are generated.
1. We have a look at best practices of O/R mappings. One-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships.
1. We create the controllers and show how scaffolding works (REST calls to the API without nothing). We write integration tests and we show client side as well.
1. We explain Grails bootstrapping.
1. We define some real world examples and we see how we could implement them.
